# Candidate Search Application

The **Candidate Search Application** is a web-based tool designed to help employers streamline their hiring process by browsing GitHub profiles. Using a personal GitHub token, the application fetches candidate information and enables users to decide whether to save or skip candidates for further review. Saved candidates are stored persistently for easy access.

The application is live and deployed on **Render**.
